[**My CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_pB20IQXkEfhOu8fMETpb6rUOdAa7-hT/view?usp=sharing)

**Hi**, my name is Hugo Sousa.

I'm a fresh graduate with a BS in Computer Science and Multimedia and a Postgraduate in Game Design. I'm mostly a programmer, with a big interest in 3D art and Computer Graphics.

I like to focus on video games or similar products, as I find it to be a very fascinating form of media that still has a lot to grow and explore. It combines aspects from a wide range of fields, like music, arquitecture, history, linguistics and more, into one cohesive whole, which also puts any developer into contact with a lot of new, diversified realities, which are ever more important in a globalized world.

During my degree, I've come into contact with a lot of different aspects of tecnology, from networking and working with electronics on Arduino, all the way to image processing with OpenCV and building games with Unity. This experience, in conjunction with the heavy emphasis on practical work, made me highly adaptable at tackling new challenges and scenarios.

As a fresh graduate, I'm now looking for work experience that will help me grow, to eventually be able to realize my ambitions to their fullest.
